*Want to contribute??*
You can checkout the official github repository for *Beast* at https://github.com/GauravDawra/Beast. Beast is primarily written in C++ for speed and optimizations. It is advised to contact me before making a pull request. We can disucuss any bugs reports, new features, optimizations and much more!!!

## Beast Structure
Beast follows a layered structure. As you can see in the *src/* folder in the repository, there are several directories. These directories contain seperate components, or layers, of the project. Each component is supposed to carry out a specific functionality.

For example, the *Parser* parses the beast build file, *Logger* logs your output to your console and handles errors, and so on...

For more information on these layers, you can drop a mail at beast-build@googlegroups.com or contact me directly at gaurav19039@iiitd.ac.in.


## Important points
Some points to take care:
1. Make sure the main source code is inside the *src/* directory and all code is well-organised.
2. Naming conventions should be followed and all identifier/function/namespace etc names should make sense.
3. There are different layers inside the *src/* folder (arranged in different directories), that specify distinct types of operations and processes involved in the build procedure. Such structure should be followed.
4. Avoid using the `using namespace` syntax. Prefix the particular namespace whenever required.
